# viewport-inspector
A tool to add into web projects that allows users to conveniently resize your website and assess mobile responsiveness.

The website to be resized is to be placed into an iframe (see main_website.html) as this allows original media queries of the resized website to apply.

This tool acts as a wrapper interface that displays your resizable website and houses the resizing functionality.
